# Data Wrangling with Pandas

## Overview
This project focuses on **data wrangling** using Python and the Pandas library.  
The goal is to transform raw data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis by performing tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and validation.

## Objectives
- Load and inspect raw datasets
- Handle missing values and duplicates
- Clean and standardize data formats
- Transform and engineer relevant features
- Export processed data for further analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

Data

Raw data is stored in data/raw/ and should not be modified.

Processed data is saved to data/processed/ after cleaning and transformation.

Workflow

Data Exploration

Inspect data structure, types, and basic statistics

Identify missing values and inconsistencies

Data Cleaning

Handle missing or invalid values

Remove duplicates

Standardize column names and formats

Data Transformation

Create new features if needed

Convert data types

Prepare data for analysis or modeling
